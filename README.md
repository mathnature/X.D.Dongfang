<h1>ðŸ”´Profile of X. D. Dongfang</h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">X. D. Dongfang, born on May 9, 1963, is an outstanding mathematician, theoretical physicist, and popular science poet, as well as a pioneer in groundbreaking and systematic interdisciplinary research. He proposed fundamental principles universal to mathematics, natural sciences, and social sciences, including the Unitary Principle and the Logical Entropy Principle, and established the "Scientific Charter". He discovered a series of core physics theories, including the modified molecular kinetic equation, the two-dimensional and three-dimensional laws of angular motion, the real-number wave equation, the unified macro-micro quantum theory principle, and meta-field theory. He founded the Equientropy Number Theory, exemplified by the elementary proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, and the complete analytical theory of partial differential equations, represented by entangled spherical harmonic functions, proposing hundreds of new mathematical theorems. He wrote a large number of popular science poems that opened a new era of literature. Having refused the unspoken rules of academic plunder, X. D. Dongfang has long endured systematic suppression and defamation. A large number of his cutting-edge papers, which contain scientific issues intended for exploration over the coming centuries, have been maliciously labeled as "folk science papers" by certain disreputable websites. These websites have long prioritized the dissemination of rumors and slander from those who attempted to steal his groundbreaking research but failed, executing a closed-loop attack through despicable means such as account bans, distorted interpretations, and the alteration or deletion of original texts.  X. D. Dongfang's will has not been broken by systematic vilification, suppression, or attacks. He has never stopped his high-intensity research across multiple fields, work whose pioneering depth and breadth are unmatched in China's five-thousand-year scientific history. The findings of this research are published in the independent journal "<a href="https://mathnature.github.io">Mathematics and Nature</a>".</p>
