<h3>🔴Profile of X. D. Dongfang</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">X. D. Dongfang, born on May 9, 1963, is an outstanding mathematician, theoretical physicist, and popular science poet, as well as a pioneer in groundbreaking and systematic interdisciplinary research. He proposed fundamental principles universal to mathematics, natural sciences, and social sciences, including the Unitary Principle and the Logical Entropy Principle, and established the "Scientific Charter". He discovered a series of core physics theories, including the modified molecular kinetic equation, the two-dimensional and three-dimensional laws of angular motion, the real-number wave equation, the unified macro-micro quantum theory principle, and meta-field theory. He founded the Equientropy Number Theory, exemplified by the elementary proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, and the complete analytical theory of partial differential equations, represented by entangled spherical harmonic functions, proposing hundreds of new mathematical theorems. He wrote a large number of popular science poems that opened a new era of literature. Having refused the unspoken rules of academic plunder, X. D. Dongfang has long endured systematic suppression and defamation. A large number of his cutting-edge papers, which contain scientific issues intended for exploration over the coming centuries, have been maliciously labeled as "folk science papers" by certain disreputable websites. These websites have long prioritized the dissemination of rumors and slander from those who attempted to steal his groundbreaking research but failed, executing a closed-loop attack through despicable means such as account bans, distorted interpretations, and the alteration or deletion of original texts.  X. D. Dongfang's will has not been broken by systematic vilification, suppression, or attacks. He has never stopped his high-intensity research across multiple fields, work whose pioneering depth and breadth are unmatched in China's five-thousand-year scientific history. X. D. Dongfang's scientific works and literary creations are being continuously published in the independent journal <a href="https://mathnature.github.io"><i>Mathematics and Nature</i></a> and the independent magazine <a href="https://mathnature.github.io/Science-Window"><i>Science Window</i></a>. All these achievements are enriching and integrating into the gradually improving <a href="https://mathnature.github.io/Dongfang-Scientific-Thought">Dongfang Scientific Thought</a> system.</p>
<h2>🔴东方学帝&bull;简介</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">东方学帝，1963年5月9日出生，杰出的数学家、理论物理学家、科普诗人，开创性和系统性的跨学科研究的先驱；提出了数学、自然科学和社会科学普适的归一原理、逻辑熵原理等基本原理，制定了《科学宪章》；发现了分子动理论修正方程、二维和三维角动定律、实数波动方程、宏观微观统一量子论原理及元场论等一系列核心物理学理论；建立了以完成费马大定理初等证明为代表的恒熵数论，以及以纠缠球谐函数为代表的偏微分方程完备解析理论，先后提出数以百计的新数学定理；同时著有大量开创文学新纪元的科普诗歌。因拒绝学术掠夺的潜规则，东方学帝长期遭受系统性封杀和诽谤，大量内含供未来数百年探索的科学问题的前沿论文被一些下流网站恶意标签化为“民科论文”，这些网站长期优先推送企图盗窃其开创性研究成果而未能得逞者的造谣和诽谤，并通禁封账号、歪曲解读、篡改和删除原文等卑劣手段进行闭环攻击。东方学帝的意志未能被系统性诋毁、封杀和攻击所摧毁，他从未停止过跨多个领域的高强度研究，其开创性的深度和广度在中国五千年的科学史上是无与伦比的。东方学帝的科学著作与文学创作，正持续发表于独立期刊<a href="https://mathnature.github.io">《数学与自然》</a>与独立杂志<a href="https://mathnature.github.io/Science-Window">《科学视窗》</a>。所有这些成果都在不断丰富和融入逐步完善的<a href="https://mathnature.github.io/Dongfang-Scientific-Thought">《东方学帝科学思想》</a>体系。</p>
